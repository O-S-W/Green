            Syrian, 10th-9th century BCE (Neo-Hittite/Hurritic), basalt (Ancient
            Near East). This relief was excavated in northern Syria at the site
            of Tell Halaf, the capital of a small independent city-state known
            as Guzana to the Assyrians, who conquered it in the late 9th century
            BCE. More than two hundred such stone reliefs (so-called
            orthostates) decorated the façade of a temple-palace built in the
            10th century BCE by a local ruler named Kapara, son of Khadiânu.

            Two Figures Sumerian (Artist) late 3rd millennium BCE (?) elephant
            ivory (Ancient Near East ) On one face of the square, flat plaque,
            two crude figures, surrounded by a thin frame, are seen in relief.
            They have long hair and thick bodies. The round eyes are incised.
            The figure at left wears a belt. The figure at right has no belt,
            but the tuft of his skirt (?) projects below his shoulders. Both
            figures appear to have their arms bent and hands raised. The piece
            is in very poor condition. A hard gray material remains in the
            recessed areas. Between the faces of the figures and between their
            feet are perforation and traces of brown material in the upper one.
